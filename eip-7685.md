## Abstract

This proposal introduces GELRWeave, a comprehensive framework for seamlessly integrating and processing general-purpose execution layer requests within the Ethereum ecosystem. GELRWeave extends the block header and body with a single field each to store request information, utilizing the block itself as a communication channel between the execution layer and the consensus layer.

## Motivation

The increasing complexity of smart contract ecosystems and the rise of contract-controlled validators have created a demand for more sophisticated, general-purpose execution layer behaviors. GELRWeave allows these systems to delegate administrative operations to their governing smart contracts, reducing reliance on intermediaries and creating a more secure and efficient environment for end users.

## Specification

### Execution Layer

#### Constants

| Name | Value | Comment |
| - | - | - |
|`FORK_TIMESTAMP` | *TBD* | Mainnet |

#### Definitions

* **`FORK_BLOCK`** -- the first block in a blockchain with the `timestamp` greater or equal to `FORK_TIMESTAMP`.
* **`request`** -- A `request` consists of a `request_type` prepended to an opaque byte array `request_data`:

```
request = request_type ++ request_data
```

Let `requests` be the list of all `request` objects in the block in ascending order by type.

#### Block structure

Beginning with the `FORK_BLOCK`, the block body **MUST** be appended with a list of requests. RLP encoding of an extended block body structure **MUST** be computed as follows:

```python
block_body_rlp = RLP([
    field_0,
    ...,
    # Latest block body field before `requests`
    field_n,

    [request_0, ..., request_k],
])
```

#### Block Header

Extend the header with a new 32 byte value `requests_root`.

Let `requests_root` be the root of a Merkle-Patricia trie keyed by the index in the list of `requests`. This is equivalent to how the transaction trie root is computed.

Beginning with the `FORK_BLOCK`, the block header **MUST** be appended with the new **`requests_root`** field. The value of this field is the trie root committing to the `requests` in the block body. **`requests_root`** field value **MUST** be computed as follows:

```python
def compute_trie_root_from_indexed_data(data):
    trie = Trie.from([(i, obj) for i, obj in enumerate(data)])
    return trie.root

block.header.requests_root = compute_trie_root_from_indexed_data(block.body.requests)
```

### Consensus Layer

Each proposal may choose how to extend `ExecutionPayload` to include the new EL request.

An additional processing step is to be added to `process_execution_payload` to iterate over and process all requests.

## Rationale

### Unified Framework

GELRWeave provides a single, cohesive system for handling diverse request types, improving efficiency and reducing complexity in the Ethereum ecosystem.

### Flexibility and Future-Proofing

The use of an opaque byte array for request data allows for future extensions and different encoding formats, ensuring GELRWeave can adapt to evolving needs.

### Enhanced Interoperability

By standardizing the way execution layer requests are handled, GELRWeave facilitates better interaction between different parts of the Ethereum network.

## Backwards Compatibility

No backward compatibility issues found. GELRWeave is designed to seamlessly integrate with existing Ethereum infrastructure.

## Test Cases

Detailed test cases will be developed to cover various scenarios, including:
- Processing of different request types
- Handling of malformed requests
- Performance under high request volumes
- Interaction with existing Ethereum operations

## Security Considerations

- Robust validation mechanisms must be implemented to ensure the integrity of requests.
- Rate limiting and prioritization strategies should be considered to prevent potential DoS attacks.
- The impact on block processing time and network load needs to be carefully monitored and optimized.
